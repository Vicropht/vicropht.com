_My website is now alive and ready for me to show the worlds my projects, thoughts and ideas!_

## My website is now live for the internet

Welcome, welcome!

I have been wanting to make this website for a while now but with all the exams and work on top I had no time for it.
Things are not looking great right now, but with the whole Home Office and studying from home change, I was able to have more time to focus on side-projects like this one!

_"So what are am I going to expect in this website"_?

I have some ideas:

- My projects
- Ideas, code snippets
- More blogs where I talk about stuff I have learned and want to share
- More to come, with time.

For now, I am just going to focus on making this website nice and easy to use, later I'll begin with the content.

So, back to programming.
Stay healthy and safe in these trying times everyone!
