## This helped me. A LOT

When I first started my job I had a lot of questions and problems to solve. I had seen a lot of memes about software developers only being Full Stack(overflow) but just like most things you see in the internet it was just something that probably was a joke... but then it wasn't.
I realized why a lot of developers had something called [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) and why it's such a hot topic, especially for people beginning to code.

After some weeks in my job I also started to have the symptomps:

- The need to be special or the best
- Fear of failure
- Denial of ability and discounting praise

And so on and so forth, _you can't really start writing your own code before practicing it by learning from others_ and that might sound like something obvious for you, reader, but not for the person sitting there and feeling like they are getting payed to copy from a random website.

## Luckily, we have a squishy organ called brain

And it can store stuff, when you do it a lot. The impostor syndrome started to fade and I lived happily ever after! *THE END*

_But that wasn't even the subject!_

Right! But here's where we start the subject!

With all the information from documentation, readmes, tutorials, stackoverflow and your boss dragging your corpse through their code and trying to make sense of everything... It's... a lot.
So I decided to document my struggles and experiences, because why not right?

Here's the first line of it:

> "Trying to finally run some tests with protractor, I studied a bit of typescript to understand some basic functionality in the code."

Reading this and remembering the struggles and how much you have grinded makes you cancel out all (or most of) those symptomps mentioned before about the impostor syndrome!

Not only does it makes you more confident about your own skills, but it can also help you remember those basic bits that you might forget sometimes because you have never ever used it again! Here's another line:

> PRO TIP: use browser.sleep(x seconds) to pause and see what is going on during the tests

I did this every 5-10 minutes before leaving work, so it wasn't even a big struggle for me that took hours to write about, neither should it be.

If you are starting out with development, I only recommend you to do the same. It might sound dumb, but in the long run, it can bring you a lot of perks ;)
