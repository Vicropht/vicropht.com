# The Lust for (and lack of) data from small companies

While big companies are constantly being criticized for collecting too much of their users data, many smaller companies have the opposite problem

What does Google, Amazon, Facebook and other big tech companies have in common? Yes, money too, but also data. Lots. Of. Data. 

- (add study about how much data one of these companies collect)
- (show how much smaller companies collect)
- (show struggles of collecting)
- (solution????)
