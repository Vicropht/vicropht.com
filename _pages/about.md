#### _Every birthday for me is a new patch version. Each lesson learned, a fixed bug. Each error, an opportunity._

Hi, my name is Victor (aka Vicropht) and I am a software developert from Sao Paulo, Brazil. I am currently studying International IT Business in the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences in Germany and, parallel to my studies, I'm also a working student at the [320 East](https://320east.de)

I aspire to be a better developer every day and this website will be my showcase for my improvements, ideas, and questions.
